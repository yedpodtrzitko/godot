This file contains the expected output of --validate-extension-api when run against the extension_api.json of the
4.0-stable tag (the basename of this file).

Only lines that start with "Validate extension JSON:" matter, everything else is considered a comment and ignored. They
should instead be used to justify these changes and describe how users should work around these changes.

========================================================================================================================

GH-74736
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/MenuBar/properties/start_index': type changed value in new API, from "bool" to "int".

The previous type was simply wrong and the getter and setter already used int.


GH-74671
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'native_structures/PhysicsServer3DExtensionMotionCollision': format changed value in new API, from "Vector3 position;Vector3 normal;Vector3 collider_velocity;real_t depth;int local_shape;ObjectID collider_id;RID collider;int collider_shape" to "Vector3 position;Vector3 normal;Vector3 collider_velocity;Vector3 collider_angular_velocity;real_t depth;int local_shape;ObjectID collider_id;RID collider;int collider_shape".
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'native_structures/PhysicsServer3DExtensionMotionResult': format changed value in new API, from "Vector3 travel;Vector3 remainder;real_t collision_safe_fraction;real_t collision_unsafe_fraction;PhysicsServer3DExtensionMotionCollision collisions[32];int collision_count" to "Vector3 travel;Vector3 remainder;real_t collision_depth;real_t collision_safe_fraction;real_t collision_unsafe_fraction;PhysicsServer3DExtensionMotionCollision collisions[32];int collision_count".

The previous type was simply wrong and didn't match the actual C++ definition. Code targeting previous versions should use the updated definition as well.

GH-?????
--------
Validate extension JSON: API was removed: classes/FramebufferCacheRD
Validate extension JSON: API was removed: classes/UniformSetCacheRD

Unsure where these come from; when dumping the interface, these do actually still exist
